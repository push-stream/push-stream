/*
A push stream pipeline is a doublely linked list.
data (write/end) travels one way, and signals (pause/resume/abort) travels the other way.

when you pipe to a stream, if it already has a source, find the first
source and pipe to that. this makes a.pipe(b.pipe(c) work, or a.pipe(b)

also, duplex streams (which, like in pull streams, are a pair {source, sink} streams)
